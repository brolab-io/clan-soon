# Introducing ClanSoon: Revolutionizing Web3 Investment

ClanSoon is a cutting-edge platform that is transforming the way investors, venture capitalists, and project founders invest in early-stage Web3 startups. With a focus on community-driven investment, ClanSoon allows users to invest alongside like-minded individuals, pooling resources to invest in high-potential projects that may have otherwise been out of reach for individual investors.

## Benefits for Investors

Investing with a community provides small investors with the opportunity to participate in larger projects and gain exposure to potentially high-return investments. By pooling resources, investors can collectively invest in startups and projects, while reducing individual risk exposure.

## Benefits for Venture Capitalists

Venture capital firms can benefit from the ClanSoon platform by allowing other investors to participate in private sales, increasing the amount of funding available to the startup while reducing their risk exposure.

## Benefits for Project Founders

ClanSoon offers project founders access to funding, community building opportunities, exposure to the Web3 community, and access to expertise and guidance from experienced investors.

## ClanSoon Features

ClanSoon's features include on-chain governance, anti-rug protection, automated financial execution, and a mobile app, providing transparency, safety, efficiency, and convenience for users.

### Create/Join a Clan

The create/join clan function allows users to create or join a community of like-minded investors with a shared interest in investing in Web3 projects.

### Make Proposal to Invest in Early-Startup

Users can submit a proposal to invest in a particular early-stage startup by providing details such as the project's name, website, team members, and any other relevant information. Other users can then view and discuss the opportunity, as well as ask questions and offer feedback.

### Auto Vesting Plan

The auto-vesting function allows investors to automatically vest their tokens over a specific period of time. This means that the tokens are gradually released to the investor's wallet, rather than being fully released all at once.

## ClanSoon Vision

ClanSoon's vision is to become the largest Investment DAO in the Web3 space, bringing over 1,000,000 users to invest in Web3. By providing a community-driven approach to investing, ClanSoon is paving the way for a new era of investment in Web3.
